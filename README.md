Hello! ðŸ˜„

To make the app I used my own state management library call it `Reactter`

https://pub.dev/packages/reactter

You can check the documentation here: <br>
https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/reactter-library.html

I hope you like my work, if you want I can explain you how the library works under the hood,
it will be a pleasure.
